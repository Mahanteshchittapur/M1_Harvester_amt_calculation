# REQUIREMENTS
INTRODUCTION: The Harvester amount calculator is the application based mini project, which is used to calculate the Harvester amount by taking input of number of boxes or acres. The tool used for writing the code in this project is code blocks.

RESEARCH: People who don’t have technical knowledge of calculating Harvester amount can use this application to calculate Harvester amount of crops, however, the defining features of an Harvester amount calculator include: • Total amount of Harvester • total number of boxes or acres • Amount per boxes or acres • The more different number of crops In addition, high-end Harvester amount calculators generally include: • Harvester amount calculation for crops like red grams, chik peas , carom • Harvester amount calculation based on number of boxes or acres BENEFITS: c) Saves Time and Cost. f) Simple and Easy to Use

### SWOT analysis: 
#### Strengths:
   Innovative,
   User-friendly.
#### Weakness:
 Cost of calculator increases as features added in the calculator increase. Opportunities: We know that we mostly use pen and paper for calculation. So tech based market always attracts the youth. Threats: Slower growth in an innovation always threat for the company in this dynamic world.

### 4’W and 1’H What:
 Harvester Amount Calculation Where: Agriculture When: Need for calculation. How: Calculates the user input as number of boxes or acres and gives the output.
